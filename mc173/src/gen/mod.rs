//! World generation module.
//! 
//! PARITY: The parity of world generation is really hard to get fully exact, mostly
//! because Minecraft itself is not at parity with itself! The world generation scheduling
//! has a huge impact on chunk populating, so this implementation is on parity but it may
//! not give exact same world on each generation, just like Minecraft. Terrain however,
//! should be exactly the same on same run.
