/// # Components 
/// 
/// This data structure stores different kind of component:
/// - Chunks, these are the storage for block, light and height map of a 16x16 column in
///   the world with a height of 128. This component has the largest memory footprint
///   overall and is stored in shared reference to avoid too much memory copy.
///   A chunk must be present in order to set block in the world.
/// - Entities, basically anything that needs to be ticked with 3 dimensional coordinates.
///   They can control their own position, velocity and look for example.
/// - Block Entities, this is a mix between entities and blocks, they can be ticked but
///   are attached to a block position that they cannot control.
/// 
/// These components are independent, but are internally optimized for access. For example
/// entities are not directly linked to a chunk, but an iterator over entities within a
/// chunk can be obtained.
/// 
/// This data structure is however not designed to handle automatic chunk loading and 
/// saving, every chunk needs to be manually inserted and removed, same for entities and
/// block entities.
/// 
/// # Logic
/// 
/// This data structure is also optimized for actually running the world's logic if 
/// needed. Such as weather, random block ticking, scheduled block ticking, entity 
/// ticking or block notifications.
/// 
/// # Events
/// 
/// This structure also allows listening for events within it through a queue of 
/// [`Event`], events listening is disabled by default but can be enabled by swapping
/// a `Vec<Event>` into the world using the [`World::swap_events`]. Events are generated
/// either by world's ticking logic or by manual changes to the world.
/// 
/// # Naming convention
/// 
/// Methods provided on this structure should follow a naming convention depending on the
/// action that will apply to the world:
/// - Methods that don't alter the world and return values should be prefixed by `get_`, 
///   these are getters and should not usually compute too much, getters that returns
///   mutable reference should be suffixed with `_mut`;
/// - Getter methods that return booleans should prefer `can_`, `has_` or `is_` prefixes;
/// - Methods that alter the world by running a logic tick should start with `tick_`;
/// - Methods that iterate over some world objects should start with `iter_`, the return
///   iterator type should preferably be a new type (not `impl Iterator`);
/// - Methods that run on internal events can be prefixed by `handle_`;
/// - All other methods should use a proper verb, preferably composed of one-word to
///   reduce possible meanings (e.g. are `schedule_`, `break_`, `spawn_`, `insert_` or
///   `remove_`).
/// 
/// Various suffixes can be added to methods, depending on the world area affected by the
/// method, for example `_in`, `_in_chunk`, `_in_box` or `_colliding`.
/// Any mutation prefix `_mut` should be placed at the very end.
/// 
/// # Roadmap
/// 
/// - Make a diagram to better explain the world structure with entity caching.
